For this project I used simply HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The approach I took was to first complete my html and add diverse set of classes and ids to all the elements that I would need for DOM manipulation and CSS flex.

I then worked on styling and responsiveness of the site. I used flex and flex-direction column which worked well with smaller screened devices then added an @media query to change those styles for better visuals on desktop. I used a hide class with display attribute none to then dynamically switch between sections of the site and to avoid creating multiple html files.

Lastly I worked on javascript, my three points of user interaction include an email form, the nav page, and a fade in style for my projects link. I set up consts for all sections of my html page and buttons. I then added event listeners to all the buttons and ran anonymous functions to either add or remove classes from those elements. For the fade in style I added the same type of event listener and had a github logo image set up as an anchor so that once it was clicked on a function would run my css fade in style and remove the hide class.

A few unsolved problems that I had were I wanted to create a carousel for my gallery however the styles for my section conflicted with the styles I wanted to add to images and I was unable to figure it out. I also wanted to create a php file to store messages I received on my site instead of having arrays to store all the data but also had a few problems there with javascript. Lastly, I wanted to add individual links to projects on the projects page but ran out of time and had to opt for just a single github link leading to the others.
